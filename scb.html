        </center>
        <p>Subhas Chandra Bose, popularly known as Netaji, was a prominent leader in India's struggle for independence. Born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Odisha, he was known for his revolutionary approach and defiance of British rule. Bose was a key figure in the Indian National Congress but later formed the Forward Bloc due to ideological differences with other leaders2.

            During World War II, he sought international support to liberate India and led the Indian National Army (INA), which fought alongside Axis powers. His efforts were instrumental in inspiring a sense of nationalism among Indians3.
            Bose's death in a plane crash on August 18, 1945, remains a topic of mystery and debate3. His legacy continues to inspire generations, and he is remembered for his famous slogan, "Give me blood, and I will give you freedom."</p>
